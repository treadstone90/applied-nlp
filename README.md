This is the course repository for Applied Natural Language Processing, with stubs for homeworks. For more information, see [the course wiki](https://github.com/utcompling/applied-nlp/wiki). There is also [a class mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en&fromgroups#!forum/ut-austin-applied-nlp). Individuals who are not in the class at UT Austin are welcome to join in the discussion.

## Requirements

* Version 1.6 of the Java 2 SDK (http://java.sun.com)

## Configuring your environment variables

The easiest thing to do is to set the environment variables `JAVA_HOME`
and `ANLP_DIR` to the relevant locations on your system. Set `JAVA_HOME`
to match the top level directory containing the Java installation you
want to use.

Next, add the directory `ANLP_DIR/bin` to your path. For example, you
can set the path in your `.bashrc` file as follows:

	export PATH=$PATH:$ANLP_DIR/bin
